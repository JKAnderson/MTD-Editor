--| https://github.com/JKAnderson/MTD-Editor

A material definition editor for the Dark Souls series. Supports MTD bundles (.mtdbnd) and single MTD files (.mtd), with or without DCX compression.
If editing the external params section is important to you, let me know and I'll probably add it.
Requires .NET 4.7.2: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net472
Windows 10 users should already have this.
