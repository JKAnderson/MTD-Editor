# MTD Editor
A material definition editor for the Dark Souls series. Supports MTD bundles (.mtdbnd) and single MTD files (.mtd), with or without DCX compression.  
If editing the external params section is important to you, let me know and I'll probably add it.  
Requires [.NET 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net472) - Windows 10 users should already have this.  

# Building
Standard users: ignore this section.  
If you want to build the app yourself, you must download [DSFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/DSFormats), then "Add existing project" to MTD Editor and add a reference.
